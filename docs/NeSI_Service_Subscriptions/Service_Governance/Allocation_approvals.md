Access to NeSI compute and storage resources is managed through
allocations. An allocation is a certain amount of a resource, or of a
rate at which a resource can be consumed, during a defined period of
time (in this case, the term of the Subscription).

Depending on the nature of your Subscription, you can choose to directly
manage allocation approvals for projects from your institution or leave
those decisions to the NeSI Support Team. See examples of some common
approval scenarios below.  
  

**Subscription used by a single project**  
If there is only one project associated with a Subscription, the
contract’s full resource entitlement can be allocated to that single
project (with the division of resources such as storage vs compute left
to the discretion of the project owner).

*Example: An institution has a specific use case or one-off need to
accessing NeSI resources to support a research project.*

 

**Subscription used by multiple projects**  
If the Subscription contract covers multiple projects, the contract
entitlement is split between the projects. The Subscriber can decide how
it should be split, or NeSI’s Support Team can review the project
requests and make a recommendation based on project requirements.  
  

*Subscriber decides*  
The Subscriber would need to inform the NeSI Support Team how the
entitlement should be split (eg. X resource to Y project).

*Example: A research institution has specific budget or resource
requirements for particular projects.  
  
*

*NeSI advises, Subscriber reviews and approves*  
NeSI’s Support Team works with the research project teams from your
institution to estimate their resource requirements. The allocation
estimates are then forwarded to the Subscription’s Service Governance
contact to be reviewed. The Subscriber can approve the requests as is,
approve them with adjustments, or reject them (in which case, our
Support Team would revisit options with the project teams affected).

*Example: A research institution is looking to grow general usage and
adoption of computational resources across a range of projects or
domains. This approach can also be a useful way to benchmark resource
needs and usage trends across the institution as a whole.*
