# Nearline Storage service

NeSI's Nearline Storage service allows you to store your data on our
hierarchical system, which consists of a staging area (disk) connected
to a tape library. Users of this service gain access to more persistent
storage space for their research data, in return for slower access to
those files that are stored on tape.

We have published the Early Access Programme [features of the Nearline
Storage service using a
portal](https://portal.productboard.com/qycxs5fchgry4t3rgm7jwhep) to
invite comments and feedback.
