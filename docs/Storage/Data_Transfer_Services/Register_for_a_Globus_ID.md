**Note:**  Currently NeSI users cannot authenticate with Globus using
institutional credentials.   Instead you need a Globus ID which becomes
your username whenever you connect to Globus.  

Go to [https://www.globusid.org](https://www.globusid.org/) to create or
set preferences associated with your Globus ID.

select "Create A Globus ID".

Enter a username/password of your choice, and the value "NeSI" in the
Organization field.
