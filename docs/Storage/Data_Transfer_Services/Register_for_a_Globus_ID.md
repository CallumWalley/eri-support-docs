**Note:**  Currently NeSI users cannot authenticate with Globus using
institutional credentials.   Instead you need a Globus ID which becomes
your username whenever you connect to Globus.  

Go to [https://www.globusid.org](https://www.globusid.org/) to create or
set preferences associated with your Globus ID.

From [ https://www.globusid.org](%C2%A0https://www.globusid.org) ,
select "Create A Globus ID".

Enter a username/password of your choice, and the value "NeSI" in the
Organization field.

Your email address will be verified - check your email and copy/paste
the verification code you receive into the next page and submit.  Upon
verification, your account will be enabled. Unless you have an
pre-existing Globus account, * press " Continue"*

Your Globus registration is complete. Grant Globus permission to access
your identity and act on your behalf by checking "Allow" on the next
box.

You can now log into the [ ](https://www.globus.org/) [Globus web
app](https://www.globus.org/app/transfer)  to transfer files.
