<h2>Install Globus Connect Personal on your workstation/laptop</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/">Globus howto page</a> on how to install a personal Globus endpoint on your computer (OS-specific instructions).</p>
<p>Once your personal endpoint is created and you have activated it, check Globus's <a href="https://app.globus.org/endpoints?scope=administered-by-me">Endpoints administered by you</a> to see whether your endpoint shows up as active.</p>

<h2>Personal Endpoint file-transfer and sharing</h2>
<p>If you need to share files from your personal computer or move files between two personal computers, you need to be part of a subscription with <a href="https://www.globus.org/subscriptions" target="_self">Globus Plus</a> enabled.</p>
<p>Globus Plus is a part of NeSI's Globus subscription. To join Globus Plus, you must become a member of the Globus sponsor group <em>New Zealand eScience Infrastructure</em>.</p>
<p>Check if your account already has this membership by viewing the <a href="https://app.globus.org/account/plus">Globus Plus</a> tab under your Account:</p>
