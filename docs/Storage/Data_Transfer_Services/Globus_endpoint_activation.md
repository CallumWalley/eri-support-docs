 

Activating an Endpoint
----------------------

When you select an endpoint to transfer data to/from, you may be asked
to authenticate with that endpoint:

height="558"}\
Transfers are only possible once you have supplied credentials that
authenticate your access to the endpoint. This process is known as
\"activating the endpoint\".  The endpoint remains active for 24 hours. 
If your transfer is not completed within that time, you\'ll get an email
from Globus asking you to re-activate the endpoint - upon reactivation,
the transfer will continue.

**Note:** Effective from 15 September 2020, the NeSI Wellington DTN
endpoint will be protected by a second factor authentication (2FA). This
change will require additional information to be entered in the
\'Password\' field when you log in. In the \'Username\' field, enter
your Māui/Mahuika username. In the \'Password\' field,
your `Password`{.c-mrkdwn__code data-stringify-type="code"} will be
equal to `First Factor`{.c-mrkdwn__code data-stringify-type="code"} +
`Second Factor`{.c-mrkdwn__code
data-stringify-type="code"} e.g. `password123456`{.c-mrkdwn__code
data-stringify-type="code"}. (Do not use any additional characters or
spaces between your password and the token number.)

Check the status of your endpoints
at <https://www.globus.org/app/endpoints> .

Managing Endpoint Activation
----------------------------

If a transfer is in progress and will not be completed before your
credentials expire, extent the activation for a further 24 hours:

On the panel on the RHS of the transfer window, click the Manage
Activation Options link.\
The default end-point activation time is 24 hrs.\
