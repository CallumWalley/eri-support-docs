 

Activating an Endpoint
----------------------

When you select an endpoint to transfer data to/from, you may be asked
to authenticate with that endpoint:

Transfers are only possible once you have supplied credentials that
authenticate your access to the endpoint. This process is known as
\"activating the endpoint\".  The endpoint remains active for 24
hours.  

The NeSI Wellington DTN V5 endpoint is protected by a second factor
authentication (2FA-same as accessing NeSI clusters).  In the
\'**Username\'** field, enter your Māui/Mahuika username. In the
\'**Password\'** field, your `Password`{.c-mrkdwn__code
stringify-type="code"} will be equal to
`Login Password (First Factor)`{.c-mrkdwn__code stringify-type="code"} +
`Authenticator Code (Second Factor)`{.c-mrkdwn__code
stringify-type="code"} e.g. `password123456`{.c-mrkdwn__code
stringify-type="code"}. (***Do not*** use any additional characters or
spaces between your password and the token number.)

Managing Endpoint Activation
----------------------------

If a transfer is in progress and will not finish in time before your
credentials expire, that transfer will pause and you will need to
reauthenticate for it to continue.
