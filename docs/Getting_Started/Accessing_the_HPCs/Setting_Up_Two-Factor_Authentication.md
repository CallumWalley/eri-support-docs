The second-factor token
-----------------------

The [6 digit code]{.wysiwyg-underline} displayed on your app can now be
used as the second factor in the authentication process.\
This code rotates every 30 seconds, and it **can only be used once**.
This means that you can only try logging in to the lander node once
every 30 seconds.
