## New and Improved

- No need to contact NeSI support anymore for joining an existing project, contact the owner of the project to add you. The join page is now updated to link to the updated documentation pages
    - https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Applying_to_join_an_existing_NeSI_project/
    - https://docs.nesi.org.nz/Getting_Started/Accounts-Projects_and_Allocations/Adding_members_to_your_NeSI_project/

- New warning email if the persistent storage is coming (close to 95%) or is at capacity (100% >)

## Fixes

- We have enforced the selection of grant question "Is the project funded by a grant/contract?" in the allocation renewal form

- We have reinstated the alert informing the user when a project does not have any current resource allocation

If you have any questions about any of the updates or fixes, please
{% include "partials/support_request.html" %}.
