NeSI\'s Consultancy service provides scientific and HPC-focussed
computational and data science support to research project across a
range of domains.

What do we do?
--------------

Examples of outcomes we could assist with (this list is general and
non-exhaustive):

-   Workflow parallelisation -- allowing more inputs to be processed
    simultaneously, usually by different instances of the software
    running side by side
-   Software parallelisation -- use of technologies such as OpenMP or
    MPI to process one single input more quickly by one instance of the
    software
-   Code optimisation -- redesign of algorithms to improve overall speed
    or efficiency of resource (CPU or memory) use
-   Improving I/O performance -- work to speed up reading from or
    writing to the disk, or to reduce the amount of data that must be
    read or written
-   Porting to GPU -- accelerate code by offloading computations to a
    coprocessor
-   Creating/Improving a visualisation workflow -- specialised remote
    visualisation solutions or developing interactive web-based
    dashboards
-   Translating Python/R/Matlab code to C/C++/Fortran for faster
    execution
-   Improving software sustainabilityÂ -- introducing best practices such
    as version control and unit testing
-   Conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis -- use visualisations and
    statistical methods to summarise the main characteristics of a
    dataset in light of scientific questions
-   Designing and fitting explanatory models -- adapt or create
    statistical models to estimate latent variables distributions from
    noisy observations and expert knowledge
-   Designing and fitting predictive models -- train machine learning
    models to predict variables of interest on unlabeled datasets
-   Cleaning data -- assist with automating the identification and
    correction of erroneous values in a dataset

What can you expect from us?
----------------------------

During a consultancy project we aim to provide:

-   Expertise and advice
-   An agreed timeline to develop or improve a solution (typical
    projects are of the order of 1 day per week for up to 4 months but
    this is determined on a case-by-case basis)
-   Training, knowledge transfer and/or capability development
-   A summary document outlining what has been achieved during the
    project
-   A case study published on our website after the project has been
    completed, to showcase the work you are doing on NeSI

What is expected of you?
------------------------

Consultancy projects are intended to be a collaboration and thus some
input is required on your part. You should be willing to:

-   Contribute to a case study upon successful completion of the
    consultancy project
-   Complete a short survey to help us measure the impact of our service
-   Attend regular meetings (usually via video conference)
-   Invest time to answer questions, provide code and data as necessary
    and make changes to your workflow if needed
-   [Acknowledge](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing/guidelines/acknowledgement-and-publication)
    NeSI in article and code publications that we have contributed to,
    which could include co-authorship if our contribution is deemed
    worthy
-   Accept full ownership/maintenance of the work after the project
    completes (NeSI\'s involvement in the project is limited to the
    agreed timeline)

How do you get access to NeSI consultancy?
------------------------------------------

Researchers from collaborator institutions (University of Auckland,
NIWA, University of Otago and Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research) and
those with Merit projects can usually access consultancy at no cost to
themselves, based on their institution\'s or MBIE\'s investment into
NeSI.

If you are interested to find out more or apply for a project, please
contact us ([mailto:support\@nesi.org.nz](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz))
to set up an initial meeting, where we can complete the consultancy
application form together.
