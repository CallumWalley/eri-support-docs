NeSI hosts weekly "Getting Started on NeSI" workshops for researchers
new to NeSI (or existing users who would like a refresh), to help you
get started on the systems. These sessions are also open to anyone
interested in learning more about High Performance Computing (HPC) using
NeSI, prior to [getting a NeSI
account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/applyforaccess).

The focus of these introductory sessions is to share an overview of NeSI
systems and the HPC platforms\' capabilities, the available software and
environment modules, and discuss some best practice and common commands
for submitting, scheduling, and optimising your jobs on the system.

These introductory workshops are hosted **online at 1:00 PM on
Wednesdays** (except public or University holidays). To receive the Zoom
videoconference link for these sessions, please [contact NeSI
