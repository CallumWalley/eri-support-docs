**How Does It Work**
--------------------

Each session follows a casual \'drop-in / drop-out\' format, where you
can pop in at any point during the hour and stay for as long or as
little as you\'d like. 

Also, don\'t worry if you have a question or challenge that can\'t be
solved on the spot. We can always use the Office Hours to collect some
basic information about your issue and then reconnect with you at a
later time to troubleshoot things further.

 

**Other ways to get help**
--------------------------

Remember, you can [email Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz){.mailto}
at any time and we have a team of experts ready to answer any questions
you may have, big or small. You can also find helpful user resources,
links and documentation elsewhere in our [User Support
Centre](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb).
