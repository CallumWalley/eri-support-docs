## **How Does It Work**

Each session follows a casual \'drop-in / drop-out\' format, where you
can pop in at any point during the hour and stay for as long or as
little as you\'d like. 

Also, don\'t worry if you have a question or challenge that can\'t be
solved on the spot. We can always use the Office Hours to collect some
basic information about your issue and then reconnect with you at a
later time to troubleshoot things further.
