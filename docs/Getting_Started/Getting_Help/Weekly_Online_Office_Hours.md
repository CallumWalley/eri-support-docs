Have questions about NeSI services?   
Looking for tips on how to optimise your HPC jobs?  
Or, simply want to meet some of the team behind NeSI Support?

We run regular online Office Hours sessions, hosted via Zoom. These
sessions are open to anyone - you don't need to be an existing NeSI
user.

If you are unable to add this Office Hour session to your calendar
through these links, please email us at
<a href="mailto:training@nesi.org.nz" class="mailto">training@nesi.org.nz</a> and
we can send a calendar invite directly to you.   
  

## **How Does It Work**

Each session follows a casual 'drop-in / drop-out' format, where you can
pop in at any point during the hour and stay for as long or as little as
you'd like. 

Also, don't worry if you have a question or challenge that can't be
solved on the spot.  
We can always use the Office Hours to collect some basic information
about your issue and then reconnect with you at a later time to
troubleshoot things further.

 

## **Other ways to get help**

Remember, you can
<a href="mailto:support@nesi.org.nz" class="mailto">email Support</a> at
any time and we have a team of experts ready to answer any questions you
may have, big or small. You can also find helpful user resources, links
and documentation elsewhere in our [User Support
Centre](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb).
