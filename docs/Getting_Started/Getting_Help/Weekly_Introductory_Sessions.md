NeSI hosts weekly “Introduction to Computing on the NeSI Platforms”
session for researchers new to NeSI (or existing users who would like a
refresh), to help you get started on the systems. These sessions are
also open to anyone interested in learning more about High Performance
Computing (HPC) using NeSI, prior to [getting a NeSI
account](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/applyforaccess).

At these sessions, we give an overview of NeSI systems and the HPC
platforms' capabilities, the available software and environment modules,
and discuss some best practice and common commands for submitting,
scheduling, and optimising your jobs on the system.

These sessions are hosted **online at 1:00 PM on Wednesdays** (except
public or University holidays). To receive the Zoom video conference
link for these sessions, please [contact NeSI
Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new").
