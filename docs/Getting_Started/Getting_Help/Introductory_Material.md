<p>If you are new to NeSI, short introductory lectures are available on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvbRzoDQPkuFsIzAWaIiYgs-kConq-Hjw">here</a> to help get you started on the systems. These videos are open to anyone interested in learning more about High Performance Computing (HPC) using NeSI, prior to <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/applyforaccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a NeSI account</a>.</p>
<p>The recordings present an overview of NeSI systems and the HPC platforms' capabilities, available software and environment modules, best practice procedures, common commands for submitting jobs, and optimising your work on the system.</p>
<p>Slides used in the lectures can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TCaJnpZO-s-s4NQ1P0a89flewT7HXmn2PHrW-3EPYg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the material mentioned above, you can also seek help at our weekly "Office Hours" or by attending a Workshop.
