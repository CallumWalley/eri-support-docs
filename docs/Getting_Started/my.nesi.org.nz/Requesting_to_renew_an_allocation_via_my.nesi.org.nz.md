### Can I request any allocation size?

If you are requesting a new allocation of computing resources, we will
look at your usage history and come up with an estimated allocation size
and duration based on that history. If you think your rate of usage will
be substantially higher or lower than we estimate, you should let us
know what you think your rate of usage will be and why you expect it to
differ from our forecast.

Please be aware that:

-   First and subsequent allocations are subject to the NeSI allocation
    size and duration limits in force at the time they are considered by
    our reviewers.
-   An allocation from an institution's entitlement is subject to
    approval by that institution.

See [Project Extensions and New Allocations on Existing
Projects](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000202196) for
more details.
