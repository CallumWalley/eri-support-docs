<span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for new allocations on
existing projects are accepted and assessed in quarterly allocation
periods. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under this quarterly
call schedule, applications for new allocations on existing projects are
due in the following months:</span>

-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">April (for allocations starting 1
    June)</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">July (for allocations starting 1
    September)</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">October (for allocations starting 1
    December)</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">January (for allocations starting 1
    March)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Requests will be reviewed in the month
following the call period and researchers will be notified by the third
Monday of that month. Allocations will start on the first day of the
next month and run for one year. </span><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The diagram below illustrates how these
quarterly call periods are scheduled during the year:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you apply for a new
allocation on your existing project in the month of October, we will
review your application in October or early November, you will be
notified of your allocation by the end of November, and your allocation
will start on 1 December (as shown in the graphic below).</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing allocations</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an existing allocation, you
will be reminded about the upcoming call by email during the second
month before your project expires. For example, if your allocation
expires at the end of May, you will receive email reminders during the
month of April. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We aggregate requests and deal with them
in batches during the review month. </span>

-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply for your new allocation
    early (for example, you apply in February when your allocation isn’t
    due to end until the end of May), we will hold your request until
    April.</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply for your new allocation
    late, your request may be deprioritised by your institution, or you
    may suffer an interruption to service as we have to consider your
    request separately and later. It is possible, depending on overall
    demand, that you may have to wait for the following call before your
    request is considered.</span>
