[Existing allocations]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-------------------------------------------------

[If you have an existing allocation, you will be reminded about the
upcoming call by email during the second month before your project
expires. For example, if your allocation expires at the end of May, you
will receive email reminders during the month of April.
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[We aggregate requests and deal with them in batches during the review
month.Â ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

-   [If you apply for your new allocation early (for example, you apply
    in February when your allocation isn't due to end until the end of
    May), we will hold your request until
    April.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [If you apply for your new allocation late, your request may be
    deprioritised by your institution, or you may suffer an interruption
    to service as we have to consider your request separately and later.
    It is possible, depending on overall demand, that you may have to
    wait for the following call before your request is
    considered.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
