Requests to use NeSI resources are [submitted via a web
form](https://my.nesi.org.nz/). While the form is available at any time,
submitted requests are reviewed on a weekly, quarterly or on-demand
cycle (see [Allocations, Allocation Classes, Review
Cycles](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing-and-analytics/guidelines/allocations-allocation-classes-review)).

> ### Note {#prerequisites}
>
> If you are a member of NIWA please also ensure that you have also read
> and followed the [NIWA internal documentation for gaining access to
> the
> HPCs](https://one.niwa.co.nz/display/ONE/High+Performance+Computing+Facility+Services)
> before applying for your NeSI project. *You will only be able to
> access the link from behind the NIWA VPN.*
>
> Other institutions may also put in place, or vary, pre-approval
> processes from time to time. If you apply for a new project without
> having completed any necessary pre-approval steps, your application
> may be delayed more than usual, or we may notify you and ask you to
> obtain pre-approval from your institution.

    describing your project\'s goals
-   The scientific domain and field of study (i.e. subdomain) your
    project belongs to

    (not the start date of the research programme as a whole, or of the
    research programme\'s current or expected funding)
-   Details of how your project is funded (this will help determine
    whether you are eligible for an allocation from our
    [Merit](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000175635) class)
-   Your previous HPC experience
-   Whether you would like expert scientific programming support on your
    project

-   What software you intend to use on the [NeSI
    HPCs](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000175735).

You will also be given an opportunity to tell us anything else you think
is relevant.

> ### What Next? {#prerequisites}
>
> -   Your NeSI Project proposal will be
>     [reviewed](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000202136),
>     after which you will be informed of the outcome.
> -   We may contact you if further details are required.
