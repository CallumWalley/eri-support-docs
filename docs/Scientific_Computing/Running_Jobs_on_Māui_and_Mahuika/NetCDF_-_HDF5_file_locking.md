    <p>NeSI provides libraries for creating and accessing files in the NetCDF and HDF5 formats on both Mahuika and Mﾄ「i.</p>
<p>On Mﾄ「i, both libraries are part of the Cray Programming Environment and can be accessed using the modules 'cray-netcdf'/'cray-netcdf-hdf5parallel', and 'cray-hdf5'/'cray-hdf5-parallel'.</p>
<p>Recent versions of NetCDF and HDF5 (HDF5 1.10.x and newer) use a file locking feature. This prevents data corruption in rare cases of single-writer/multiple-reader and multiple writer access patterns.</p>
<p>On our current XC50 platform (Mﾄ「i), <strong>file locking is not yet fully supported</strong> by Cray's DVS. (DVS allows accessing the parallel file system GPFS on the XC50 compute nodes).</p>
<p>Accordingly, NetCDF-4 and HDF5 applications that write data from Mﾄ「i compute nodes need to disable file locking with:</p>
<pre><code>export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE</code></pre>
<p>If file locking is enabled, HDF5/NetCDF4 applications may experience errors such as</p>
<pre><code>ncdump: /path/to/file.nc: NetCDF: HDF error</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>Error in EM_FOPEN: NetCDF: HDF error - /path/to/file.nc </code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><span>(-101) // Error at HDF5 layer</span></pre>
<p>or</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> As file locking has to be disabled on the XC50, care should be taken to avoid concurrent reader/writer access in your application.</p>
