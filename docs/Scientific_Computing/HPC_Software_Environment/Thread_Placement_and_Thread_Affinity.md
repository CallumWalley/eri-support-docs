    <p>Multithreading with OpenMP and other threading libraries is an important way to parallelise scientific software for faster execution (see our article on <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000690275" target="_self">Parallel Execution</a> for an introduction). Care needs to be taken when running multiple threads on the HPC to achieve best performance - getting it wrong can easily increase compute times by tens of percents, sometimes even more. This is particularly important for programs that can use a large number of threads, such as TensorFlow and other software that uses Intel oneMKL.</p>
<p>Understanding thread placement and affinity, and the interplay with the Slurm workload scheduler requires some background knowledge of modern multicore HPC nodes. After explaining a few key aspects, the article will demonstrate how to configure thread placement and affinity using the Intel OpenMP library which offers detailed runtime reports and its configurations also apply to Intel oneMKL. However, the same concepts apply to other threading libraries as well, such as the GOMP library used by the GCC compiler family.</p>
<h2>Nodes, Sockets, and Physical Cores, and Logical Cores</h2>
<p>To run parallel software effectively, a modern HPC consists of many nodes, with multiple processors on each node. The processors are often simply referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket" target="_self">sockets</a> when it comes to performance, as a socket connects the processor to its RAM and other processors. A processor in each socket consists of multiple physical cores, and each physical core is split into two logical cores using a technology called <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000568236" target="_self">Hyperthreading</a>).</p>
<p>A processor also includes caches - a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache" target="_self">cache</a> is very fast memory that stores data that will be needed for the next computations, which avoids that the processor has to wait for data coming from the much slower RAM.</p>
<p>The picture below shows a simplified view of a two-socket node with two cores per socket. Most HPC nodes will have two sockets, but a lot more cores (our current HPCs have 18 to 20 cores). Each core can also be further divided into two logical cores (or hyperthreads, as mentioned before).</p>
<p><img src="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/article_attachments/360002169395/NodeSocketCore.png" alt="NodeSocketCore.png"></p>
<p>It is very important to note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each socket only has access to its own RAM - it will need to ask the processor in the other socket if it wants to access that RAM space, and that takes longer (this is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access" target="_self">NUMA</a> architecture)</li>
<li>Each socket has a fast cache that is shared between all cores in that socket</li>
<li>Each core has its own private fast cache as well</li>
</ul>
<p>For a thread that runs on a given core, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is "local" when it is stored in RAM or cache close to that core and can be accessed very quickly</li>
<li>Data is "remote" when it is stored elsewhere and takes extra time to access</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread Placement and Affinity</h2>
<p>Given the arrangement of node, sockets, and cores, with different access to RAM and caches, we need to to make sure that our threads are located as close as possible to their data, and as close as possible to each other if they need to work on the same piece of data. Threads can even share the data in a cache for maximum performance.</p>
<p>This configuration is is called <strong>thread placement</strong>.</p>
<p>The operating system on a computer with multiple cores can normally freely move processes and threads around between the different cores, to make sure that the overall workload is spread evenly across the available cores. This is very useful on general purpose computers like laptops that run a great number of applications at the same time.</p>
<p>However, moving processes and threads can cause performance problems on an HPC, where we usually want to run only a single processe or threads per core for best performance. The problem is that every time a process or thread moves from one core to another, registers and caches need to be flushed and reloaded. This can become very costly if it happens often, and our threads may also no longer be close to their data, or be able to share data in a cache.</p>
<p>The mechanism that keeps our threads on their cores is called<strong> thread affinity</strong>.</p>
<h2>Example Program</h2>
<p>We will use the Intel OpenMP library in the following examples. The same configurations can be used for all software that is compiled with the Intel compiler, or uses Intel oneMKL. Other OpenMP libraries such as GOMP have similar configurations.</p>
<p>Use a text editor to save the following test program in a text file called "hello_world.c":</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;omp.h&gt;<br>int main()<br>{<br>    #pragma omp parallel<br>    printf("Hello World from Thread %i!\n", omp_get_thread_num());<br>    return 0;<br>}</pre>
<p>On Mahuika or MƒÅui Ancil, compile the program using the commands</p>
<pre>module load intel/2018b<br>icc -o hello_world.x -qopenmp hello_world.c</pre>
<p>Running the program with two threads should return the following output (although the order of threads may be different):</p>
<pre>OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./hello_world.x<br>Hello World from Thread 0!<br>Hello World from Thread 1!</pre>
<h2>Configuring Slurm</h2>
<p>The Slurm scheduler reserves resources on compute nodes according to our requests. Unless we ask for a full node, we will get a subset of the available logical cores. Let us start by asking for 1 node, and 1 process with 3 threads using only physical cores (no hyperthreading):</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash -e<br>#SBATCH --job-name=threads<br>#SBATCH --time=00:00:30<br>#SBATCH --nodes=1<br>#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # We will run on a single process<br>#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=3        # ... and with 3 threads<br>#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread     # No hyperthreading<br><br>export KMP_AFFINITY=verbose      # Get detailed output<br>module load intel/2018b<br>srun hello_world.x</pre>
<p>Running the script should present you with output similar to this, although the number of "packages" (sockets) and cores may deviate if Slurm allocates cores on more than one socket (note also that "threads" means what we called logical cores earlier on):</p>
<pre>OMP: Info #209: KMP_AFFINITY: decoding x2APIC ids.<br>OMP: Info #207: KMP_AFFINITY: Affinity capable, using global cpuid leaf 11 info<br>OMP: Info #154: KMP_AFFINITY: Initial OS proc set respected: {0,6,8}<br>OMP: Info #156: KMP_AFFINITY: 3 available OS procs<br>OMP: Info #157: KMP_AFFINITY: Uniform topology<br>OMP: Info #179: KMP_AFFINITY: 1 packages x 3 cores/pkg x 1 threads/core (3 total cores)<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 156318 tid 156318 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {0,6,8}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 156318 tid 156320 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {0,6,8}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 156318 tid 156321 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {0,6,8}<br>Hello World from Thread 0!<br>Hello World from Thread 1!<br>Hello World from Thread 2!</pre>
<p>The runtime library tells us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slurm provided 3 physical cores with only 1 logical core ("thread") per physical core - no hyperthreading</li>
<li>We got the cores with IDs 0, 6, 8 in this particular example - these happen to be on the same socket, but that is not guaranteed!</li>
<li>All our threads are "bound" to all 3 cores at once - this means that no affinity setup has been made, and the threads are free to move from one core to another</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting "--hint=multithread" instead to activate hyperthreading should result in output similar to this:</p>
<pre>OMP: Info #209: KMP_AFFINITY: decoding x2APIC ids.<br>OMP: Info #207: KMP_AFFINITY: Affinity capable, using global cpuid leaf 11 info<br>OMP: Info #154: KMP_AFFINITY: Initial OS proc set respected: {6,8,46}<br>OMP: Info #156: KMP_AFFINITY: 3 available OS procs<br>OMP: Info #158: KMP_AFFINITY: Nonuniform topology<br>OMP: Info #179: KMP_AFFINITY: 1 packages x 2 cores/pkg x 2 threads/core (2 total cores)<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 158044 tid 158044 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {6,8,46}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 158044 tid 158046 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {6,8,46}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 158044 tid 158047 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {6,8,46}<br>Hello World from Thread 0!<br>Hello World from Thread 1!<br>Hello World from Thread 2!</pre>
<ul>
<li>Slurm provided 2 physical cores with 2 logical cores ("threads") each and 3 logical cores in total (we don't get the remaining logical core on the second physical core, even though that logical core will not be given to other jobs)</li>
<li>Notice that we now get logical core IDs 6, 8, 46 - IDs 6 and 46 are the first and second logical core inside the first physical core, while ID 8 is a logical core in the second physical core</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up thread placement and affinity</h2>
<p>We will now place our threads on cores in a specific order and bind them to these cores, so that they can no longer move to another core during execution.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> As mentioned above, Slurm does NOT guarantee that all threads will be placed on the same socket even if our job would fit entirely within one socket. This needs to be taken into account when optimising threading setup.</p>
<p>Let us start with the following setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run with "--hint=multithread" so that our program can access all available logical cores</li>
<li>Bind threads to physical cores ("granularity=core") - they are still free to move between the two logical cores inside a given physical core</li>
<li>Place threads close together ("compact") - although this has little significance here as we use all available cores anyway, we still need to specify this to activate thread affinity</li>
<li>Bind thread IDs to logical core IDs in simple numerical order by setting permute and offset specifiers to 0</li>
</ul>
<pre>#!/bin/bash -e<br>#SBATCH --job-name=thread_placement_affinity<br>#SBATCH --time=00:00:30<br>#SBATCH --nodes=1<br>#SBATCH --ntasks=1<br>#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4<br>#SBATCH --hint=multithread<br><br>export KMP_AFFINITY=verbose,granularity=core,compact,0,0<br>module load intel/2018b<br>srun hello_world.x</pre>
<p>You should get this result:</p>
<pre>OMP: Info #209: KMP_AFFINITY: decoding x2APIC ids.<br>OMP: Info #207: KMP_AFFINITY: Affinity capable, using global cpuid leaf 11 info<br>OMP: Info #154: KMP_AFFINITY: Initial OS proc set respected: {2,7,42,47}<br>OMP: Info #156: KMP_AFFINITY: 4 available OS procs<br>OMP: Info #157: KMP_AFFINITY: Uniform topology<br>OMP: Info #179: KMP_AFFINITY: 1 packages x 2 cores/pkg x 2 threads/core (2 total cores)<br>OMP: Info #211: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc to physical thread map:<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 2 maps to package 0 core 2 thread 0<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 42 maps to package 0 core 2 thread 1<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 7 maps to package 0 core 10 thread 0<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 47 maps to package 0 core 10 thread 1<br>OMP: Info #144: KMP_AFFINITY: Threads may migrate across 1 innermost levels of machine<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 177638 tid 177638 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {2,42}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 177638 tid 177640 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {2,42}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 177638 tid 177641 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {7,47}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 177638 tid 177642 thread 3 bound to OS proc set {7,47}<br>Hello World from Thread 0!<br>Hello World from Thread 1!<br>Hello World from Thread 2!<br>Hello World from Thread 3!</pre>
<p>As requested, pairs of threads are now bound to both logical cores inside a given physical core and can move between those two.</p>
<p>Choosing "granularity=fine" instead of "granularity=core" will bind each thread to a single logical core, and threads can no longer move at all:</p>
<pre>[...]<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178055 tid 178055 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {2}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178055 tid 178057 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {42}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178055 tid 178058 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {7}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178055 tid 178059 thread 3 bound to OS proc set {47}<br>[...]</pre>
<p>Note in the output of the last example how threads 0 and 1 fill up the first and second logical core (IDs 2 and 42) of the first physical core, while threads 3 and 4 are placed on the second physical core (IDs 7 and 47). We can influence placement by manipulating the "permute" and "offset" values. Choosing "1,0" results in:</p>
<pre>[...]<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178741 tid 178741 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {2}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178741 tid 178743 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {7}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178741 tid 178744 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {42}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 178741 tid 178745 thread 3 bound to OS proc set {47}<br>[...]</pre>
<p>Threads 0 and 1 are now placed on the first logical cores of each physical core, threads 2 and 3 on the second logical cores.</p>
<p>We can also choose an offset - setting "0,1" shifts placement of thread IDs onto logical core IDs by 1:</p>
<pre>[...]<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 2 maps to package 0 core 2 thread 0<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 42 maps to package 0 core 2 thread 1<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 3 maps to package 0 core 3 thread 0<br>OMP: Info #171: KMP_AFFINITY: OS proc 43 maps to package 0 core 3 thread 1<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 180198 tid 180198 thread 0 bound to OS proc set {42}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 180198 tid 180200 thread 1 bound to OS proc set {3}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 180198 tid 180201 thread 2 bound to OS proc set {43}<br>OMP: Info #247: KMP_AFFINITY: pid 180198 tid 180202 thread 3 bound to OS proc set {2}<br>[...]</pre>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no single best choice for setting up thread placement and affinity, it depends on the application. Also keep in mind that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job runtimes can be affected by other jobs that are running on the same node and share network access, memory bus, and some caches on the same socket</li>
<li>The operating system on a node will also still need to run its own processes and threads</li>
</ul>
<p>This can lead to a trade-off between restricting thread movement for better performance while allowing some flexibility for threads that are held up by other jobs or system processes. It is therefore worth trying out different affinity setups to see which one works best for your program.</p>
<p>It is usually a good idea to start without hyperthreading and activate thread affinity by choosing:</p>
<pre>#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread<br>export KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,0,0</pre>
<p>You can now try out other configurations and compare runtimes.</p>
