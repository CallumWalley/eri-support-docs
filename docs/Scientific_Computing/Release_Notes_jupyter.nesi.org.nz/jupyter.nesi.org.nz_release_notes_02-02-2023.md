    ## New and Improved

-   Updated JupyterHub to v2.3.1
-   Updated JupyterLab to v3.5.3
-   Switched to Python 3.10 for running JupyterLab (kernels are
    unaffected)
    -   Note: if you have previously installed Python packages in your
        home directory using Python 3.10, we recommend cleaning out your
        *~/.local/Python-3.10-gimkl-2022a* directory, as it could
        conflict with our JupyterLab installation, and consider
        [Installing packages in a Python virtual
        environment](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/207782537-Python#installing_packages_in_a_python_virtual_environment)
