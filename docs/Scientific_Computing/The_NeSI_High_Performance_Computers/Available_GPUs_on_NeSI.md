NeSI has a range of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate
compute-intensive research and support more analysis at scale. Depending
on the type of GPU, you can access them in different ways, such as via
batch scheduler (Slurm), interactively (using [Jupyter on
NeSI](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001555615)<span
class="loader-wrapper"></span>), or Virtual Machines (VMs). 

The table below outlines the different types of GPUs, who can access
them and how, and whether they are currently available or on the future
roadmap.

If you have any questions about GPUs on NeSI or the status of anything
listed in the table, [contact
Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new).
