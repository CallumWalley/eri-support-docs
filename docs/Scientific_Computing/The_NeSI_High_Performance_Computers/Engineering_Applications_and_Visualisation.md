    <h1>Definitions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Interactive: User can effect program execution in real time.
<ul>
<li>Visualisation: Graphical Rendering in real time. As used here this is explicitly referring to visualisation on a NeSI cluster (as opposed to local visualisation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Batch: All program commands are given at launch, and runs without user input.
<ul>
<li>Job Scheduler: Batch jobs are managed by a central controller to maximise resource efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remote Job Management: All interface with the NeSI cluster is handled backed, allowing the user to continue using the same interface. <em>This generally does not involve Visualisation, </em>any rendering is likely happening locally. </p>
<p>Remote Display: X11, NiceDCV.</p>
