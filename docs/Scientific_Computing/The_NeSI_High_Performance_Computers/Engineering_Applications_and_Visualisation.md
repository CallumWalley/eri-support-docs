# Definitions

-   Interactive: User can effect program execution in real time.
    -   Visualisation: Graphical Rendering in real time. As used here
        this is explicitly referring to visualisation on a NeSI cluster
        (as opposed to local visualisation).

 

-   Batch: All program commands are given at launch, and runs without
    user input.
    -   Job Scheduler: Batch jobs are managed by a central controller to
        maximise resource efficiency.

 

 

 

 

Remote Job Management: All interface with the NeSI cluster is handled
backed, allowing the user to continue using the same interface. *This
generally does not involve Visualisation, *any rendering is likely
happening locally. 

Remote Display: X11, NiceDCV.
