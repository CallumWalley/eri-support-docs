The NeSI access policy, agreed by representatives of the Crown and
NeSI's partner institutions, establishes several allocation classes. In
general terms, the allocation class granted to your project is used to
decide who pays for that aspect of your project's consumption of NeSI
services.

### [Proposal Development](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000175675)

A short-term allocation available to researchers from any New Zealand
research institution. During this allocation you will:

-   Find out whether your software works on one of the NeSI platforms.
-   See how your software scales when you run it on more processors.
-   Start estimating how many core hours per year you will need for your
    project.

Once your Proposal Development allocation is well underway (or has
ended), you are welcome to apply for a further allocation, which will be
granted from one of our other allocation classes.

*Depending on your institutional affiliation and your project's
satisfaction of eligibility criteria, your project's initial allocation
may have the same limits as a Proposal Development allocation but be
from one of our other allocation classes.*

### [Merit](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000175635)

Intended for highly skilled research teams carrying out high quality
research funded via a peer review process that supports the [New Zealand
Government's Science
Goals](http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/funding-info-opportunities/document-image-library/NSSI%20Final%20Document%202015.pdf).

A named investigator on a peer reviewed research grant or contract
covering the entire allocation period. Students under the supervision of
a named investigator are eligible at NeSI's discretion.

If your institution is a NeSI Collaborator, your project's allocation,
if approved, will be provided out of your institution's entitlement.

Examples likely to qualify:

-   MBIE managed research funds
-   Health Research Council funding
-   Royal Society of New Zealand funding, e.g. Marsden grants
-   SSIF programme funding (previously known as CRI Core funding)
-   Research programmes forming part of a National Science Challenge
-   Research programmes forming part of a Centre of Research Excellence
    (CoRE)

*Those engaged in privately funded research or research funded by a
foreign government are unlikely to qualify.*

### [Postgraduate](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000175695)

Standard allocation for anyone enrolled at a New Zealand degree-granting
institution and working on a postgraduate research programme (e.g. PhD
or Masters by research) approved by that institution. If your
institution is a NeSI Collaborator, your project's allocation, if
approved, will be provided out of your institution's entitlement.

*Applicants in undergraduate programmes (including Honours programmes)
or graduate programmes based on coursework are not eligible for
Postgraduate allocations.*

### [Institutional](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000176116)

Available if you work for or study at one of the institutions that is a
NeSI collaborator, or has a subscription to the relevant NeSI service.

> ### Warning
>
> If you are employed by and/or study at multiple institutions, it is
> your responsibility to find out which of those institutions is
> supporting your proposed work with NeSI. Whether and how your research
> is eligible to receive allocations of NeSI resources depends on its
> host institution.

Allocations from an institution's entitlement are subject to approval by
that institution. Some institutions require pre-approval or recover
costs for their NeSI usage through internal charging.

If you are applying in your capacity as a staff member or student at a
NeSI collaborator, your project will be considered for an Institutional
allocation rather than a Merit or Postgraduate allocation.
