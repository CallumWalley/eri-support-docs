<p>Most New Zealand universities and Crown Research Institutes are members of the <a href="https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/tuakiri/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuakiri authentication federation</a>, but many other institutions, including private sector organisations and most central and local government agencies, are not. If you are not affiliated with an organisation supported by the <a href="https://www.reannz.co.nz/products-and-services/tuakiri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuakiri</a> federation, you can request access via <a href="https://my.nesi.org.nz/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my.nesi.org.nz/register</a>.</p>

<p>We will review your request and, if we approve it, we will create a Tuakiri Virtual Home account for you, which you can use to login to my.nesi.org.nz. Once we have done so, the Tuakiri system will send you an automatically generated email inviting you to activate your account. You will need to activate your account before you can log in to my.nesi.org.nz.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-tip">
<h3 id="no-activation">What if I don't get the account activation email?</h3>
<p>Some organisations' email servers are known to block Tuakiri's account activation emails. If you haven't received your Tuakiri account activation email by the end of the next business day after you applied for an account, please check your junk mail and/or quarantine folders. If you still can't find the email,Â <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/requests/new">contact our support team</a>.</p>
