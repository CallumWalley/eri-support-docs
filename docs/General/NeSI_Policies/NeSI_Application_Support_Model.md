    <p>The NeSI policy for management of scientific application software is based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>NeSI will install and maintain software in a central location if it will be useful to a number of users, or if the effort to install it is small.</li>
<li>Users may install software in their <code>/home</code> or <code>/nesi/project/</code> directories, provided that they have a license for the software (if needed) that permits the software to be used on NeSI systems.</li>
<li>NeSI will provide users with a reasonable amount of help when they are installing their own software.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more detail: Application software will be supported using a three-tier model.</p>
<h2>Tier 1</h2>
<p>Includes applications (meaning tools, libraries and science applications) which:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Have a wide user base among users of the NeSI Compute and Analytics Service, either because they are used by many users within one or many Projects or are easy to install.</li>
<li>Are centrally installed, tested (including scaling), optimised, documented and upgraded as new versions become available.</li>
<li>The NeSI Applications and/or Computational Science Team staff often (but not always) have in-depth knowledge of the application science – in which case they can provide specialist support to researchers. However, if no in-depth knowledge is available in the team(s), this does not prevent an application from being in Tier 1.</li>
<li>Support documentation will be provided, including licensing information and scaling data etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tier 2</h2>
<p>Includes applications (meaning tools, libraries and science applications) which:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Have a small but important user base, meaning they are used by several users and 1 or several projects.</li>
<li>Are centrally installed, standard regression tests are applied (if provided/available) and will be upgraded upon user request and as time permits.</li>
<li>NeSI Applications and/or Computational Science Team staff have no “in depth” knowledge of the application.</li>
<li>The support documentation provides basic information on how to use the software.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tier 3</h2>
<p>Includes applications (meaning tools, libraries and science applications) that are required by one user, or have very limited use, in which case:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>NeSI will (if required) provide limited guidance to the user so that they can install the software in their home directory.</li>
<li>The user will be responsible for managing this software</li>
<li>No support documentation will be provided by NeSI</li>
<li>The software will not be listed in the software catalogue</li>
</ol>
<p>NeSI will publish the current list of software (including all versions), with links to the Support documentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<!--<p>Applications for central installation of new software on the NeSI systems (post initial implementation on the new platforms) will be made via an <a href="#_Application_Installation_Request">Application Installation request form</a>, where sufficient information will need to be provided to enable NeSI to make a decision as to which Tier the software falls in.  Applications for Tier 1 support will require approval by NeSI Management (or as delegated, e.g. to Solutions or HPC Compute and Analytics lead’s).</p>-->
