<p>Your project will typically be considered for an Institutional allocation if you work for or study at one of the institutions that is a NeSI collaborator, or has a subscription to our HPC Compute &amp; Analytics service. If you are unsure whether or not your institution has a current subscription with NeSI, please ask us via <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new">a support request</a>.</p>
<p>Allocations from an institution's entitlement are subject to approval by that institution. Some institutions require pre-approval or recover costs for their HPC usage through internal charging. You are welcome to begin the application process by <a href="https://my.nesi.org.nz/html/request_project/">applying for a new project online</a>. Our team is happy to answer any questions you may have through the application process, and we will let you know if you are expected to directly seek approval from your institution.</p>
<p>If you are a postgraduate student at a NeSI collaborator, your project will likely be considered for an Institutional allocation rather than a <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000175635" target="_self">Merit</a> or <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000175695" target="_self">Postgraduate</a> allocation.</p>
