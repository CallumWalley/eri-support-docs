    <p>The Postgraduate allocation class supports capability development of postgraduate students enrolled at a New Zealand university.</p>
<p>To be considered for a Postgraduate allocation, your application must satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be enrolled at a New Zealand degree-granting institution and working on a postgraduate research programme (e.g. PhD or Masters by research) approved by that institution. Applicants in undergraduate programmes (including Honours programmes) or graduate programmes based on coursework are not eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your application satisfies these criteria, we may not award your project an allocation from the Postgraduate class:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your institution is a NeSI Collaborator or Subscriber, your project's allocation will most likely be made from your institution's entitlement.</li>
<li>If you have not used an HPC previously, we may award your project a Proposal Development allocation first. In this case, your project may be considered for a Postgraduate allocation after your Proposal Development allocation is complete.</li>
<li>Some allocation requests may be declined, or alternatively postponed until a later time, if there is insufficient computing capacity available to meet demand.</li>
</ul>
