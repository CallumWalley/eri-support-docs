<p>A Proposal Development allocation is a short-term allocation of up to 2,000 compute units per month (on Mahuika) or 50 node-hours per month (on Māui) or both, for up to six months. During your Proposal Development allocation you can find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether your software can run on a <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000175735">NeSI HPC</a>,</li>
<li>how your software scales to multiple cores or across compute nodes,</li>
<li>approximately how many compute units or node hours your research project is likely to need.</li>
</ul>
<p>If:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are new to NeSI or have not run this particular programme of research on a NeSI system before, and</li>
<li>you work at a New Zealand institution that is not a NeSI collaborating institution, and</li>
<li>we decide that your workflow is likely to be a good technical fit for our facilities,</li>
</ul>
<p>it is likely that we will initially award your research programme a Proposal Development allocation.</p>
<p>Once you have completed your Proposal Development allocation, you are welcome to apply for a further allocation. If you are successful, the project's next allocation will be from another of the <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000925176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allocation classes</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/articles/360000202136">How Applications are Reviewed</a> section provides additional important information for applicants.</p>
