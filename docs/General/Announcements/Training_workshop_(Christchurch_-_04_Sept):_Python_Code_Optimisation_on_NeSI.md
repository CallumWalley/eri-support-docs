This September, as a pre-conference workshop to its 2019 Science Coding
Conference, the NeSI Training Team is hosting a half-day training
workshop on how to optimise Python programs so that they run more
efficiently on multi-core systems like NeSI's high-performance
platforms.

Designed for intermediate to advanced NeSI users, this half-day,
hands-on training will cover:

-   Profiling serial and parallel applications using ARM map
-   Writing a Python C extension
-   Parallelising a Python C extension using OpenMP

The aim of this training is to increase users\' confidence in
identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks so that they can make the
most out of their core hours.

*Prerequisites*

In order to get the most out of this training, it is strongly
recommended that you:

-   Have a NeSI account
-   Can bring your own laptop to the session
-   Are able to login to a Unix computer
-   Are comfortable with typing Unix and git commands (e.g you can clone
    git repositories, and navigate files/ directories)
-   Are able to use an editor (like nano or vim for example) to do
    things like open, edit, save, and close a file.
-   Have some knowledge of Python and C/C++

We encourage anyone interested to register online (space is limited):Â \
