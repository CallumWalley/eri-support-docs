Like many of you, the NeSI team has transitioned to work from home in
response to New Zealand\'s Alert Level 4 lockdown for
[COVID-19](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus).

Please note, the NeSI [HPC
platform](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/sections/360000034335)

are still available to support your research at this time. NeSI Support
will be investigating any system issues and/or resolving problems
remotely, and if you need assistance with accessing the platforms, or
have questions about any of NeSI's [other
services](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services) or your NeSI account, our
regular channels for support remain open:
