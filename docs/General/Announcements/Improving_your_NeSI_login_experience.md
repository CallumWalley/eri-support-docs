[Over the last few months, a number of improvements have been made to
how you set up your accounts and log into NeSI for the first
time. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Many of these changes were made in response to direct feedback from
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[a survey conducted in
2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"}](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000664296-2018-Platforms-Migration-Survey)[
of users' experience migrating to the new platforms. For example, some
users reported issues and system behaviours that prevented them from
logging in, while others said the instructions for logging in were
difficult to follow.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Ensuring that NeSI's [HPC
platforms](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/sections/360000034335)
are accessible and easy to use is a primary goal for our team. With that
in mind, we have been working to simplify and improve the variety of
components related to this
experience. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Below is an outline of some of
the changes we have made and what this means for you as a
user: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Improved method for setting / resetting passwords**

[Users can now set and reset their NeSI HPC account password via the
my.nesi.org.nz web interface. Previously, users had to use the command
line interface via lander02.nesi.org.nz (note: lander02.nesi.org.nz has
since been [replaced with
lander.nesi.org.nz](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001253175-Changes-to-the-lander-node-during-rolling-outage)).

-   [Users now have a much faster and easier self-service option for
    handling their passwords. This is particularly useful if a user has
    forgotten his/her password.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Addressed some key issues related to account sign-up / sign-in**

[We have fixed a bug that was causing some institutional networks to be
banned.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[We have increased the number of allowed log in attempts.

    smoother process for signing in and/or signing up via the
    my.nesi.org.nz portal.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Enhanced my.nesi.org.nz design and features**

    the expanded menu options provide an easier path to more information
    about project applications and direct links to other useful NeSI
    services, such as the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Data Transfer

    reference guide for new or novice users.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
