At approximately 2pm today an upgrade to network links connecting the
NeSI HPC Lander nodes to the outside world inadvertently resulted in an
outage to the Lander nodes for about 5 minutes. During this time
existing user sessions were disconnected and new connection attempts
failed. No interruptions were experienced within the HPCs, all
previously submitted and running jobs continued as usual.

Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience.
