NeSI uses its [System Status page](https://status.nesi.org.nz/) as a
tool to communicate planned and unplanned maintenance and interruptions
to service. Our Status page includes a list of components that reflect
high-level functional aspects of NeSI's platforms and services, as well
as a more specific detailed list covering different platform elements.  
  
Recently, we made adjustments to our Status page's default notification
settings to balance timely notice of planned and unplanned issues
against superfluous or unsolicited noise.   
  
Now, instead of automatically subscribing new users for all
notifications, we will initially only subscribe you to receive status
notices about the following key components:

-   'Submit new HPC Jobs' - notices regarding job submission to NeSI
    systems
-   'Jobs running on HPC' - notices regarding job status on NeSI systems
-   'Jupyter on NeSI' - notices regarding our Jupyter Service
-   'HPC Storage' - notices regarding storage resources on NeSI systems

Effective Friday 20 October, we adjusted all existing and non-customised
Status page subscriptions to match this shorter notification list.

This change ensures you receive the most relevant and high value
information by push notification, while leaving the option available for
you to subscribe to more specific updates.

 

## Customise your notifications

You can subscribe to and unsubscribe from components at any time,
allowing you to customise your status notifications based on which
components you are using or most interested in at the time. Visit our
[Managing Notification Preferences
page](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/4563294188687) for
instructions.
