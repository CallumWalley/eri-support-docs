As part of our ongoing focus to support [national data science
infrastructure
investments](https://www.nesi.org.nz/news/2021/04/building-new-zealands-data-science-and-ai-capabilities) that
enable researchers to stay at the top of their fields, NeSI is rolling
out additional NVIDIA A100 GPU cards in early 2022, specifically 4-way
configured HGX A100s with 80GB memory each.

These new resources, alongside our platform's [specialised software
capabilities](https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing-and-analytics/data-analytics-and-machine-learning), are
poised support access for a larger set of users, as well as more
advanced and demanding performance needs.

To help us prepare to launch these new GPU cards, we are seeking
researchers / research groups interested in assisting us with some early
testing and use case applications. We will have specific features and
functionality we'll be asking you to help us test, using your project's
code(s).

**The testing phase would run between February - April 2022** (exact
dates to be confirmed). We are collecting expressions of interest now
and will be in touch with candidates in late January to confirm next
steps.

Please note, the following tools WILL be available during this testing
phase:

-   [Singularity
    (container)](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001107916-Singularity)
-   [Miniconda](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001580415-Miniconda3)%20)
-   [Tensorflow /
    PyTorch](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000990436-TensorFlow-on-GPUs)

The following tools WILL NOT be available during this testing phase:

-   [Docker](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001107916-Singularity#using_a_docker_container)
-   Interactive access to the GPU
    via [Jupyter](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001555615-Jupyter-on-NeSI)
