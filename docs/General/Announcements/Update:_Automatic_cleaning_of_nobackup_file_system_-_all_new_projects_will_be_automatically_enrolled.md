The staged rollout of [automatic cleaning of the nobackup file
system](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001162856-Automatic-cleaning-of-nobackup-file-system)
resumed on Tuesday 24 March 2020, and several dozen projects are now
enrolled. 

The next phase of rollout began in July, and these data management
protocols also now apply to the following groups:

-   all new projects will be automatically enrolled as we provision
    them.
-   existing projects with exemptions will be re-enrolled when the
    reason for the exemption no longer applies. We will contact each of
    these project teams at the time.
-   existing projects that are not already enrolled or exempted will be
    progressively enrolled as they are issued new allocations of compute
    time.

Further information about this process is detailed on [this
page](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001162856-Automatic-cleaning-of-nobackup-file-system).

your nobackup directory, please [contact
