If you are unable to add these Office Hours sessions to your calendar
through these links, please email us at <training@nesi.org.nz> and we
can send a calendar invite directly to you. 

Each session will follow a casual \'drop-in / drop-out\' format, where
you can pop in at any point during the hour and stay for as long or as
little as you\'d like! Come to ask questions or simply say hello and
chat or observe. Also, don\'t worry if you have a question or challenge
that can\'t be solved on the spot. We can always use the Office Hours to
collect some basic information about your issue and then reconnect with
you at a later time to troubleshoot things further.

These Office Hours sessions are being trialled as another way for you to
connect with our team. \
Lastly, remember you can [email
Support](mailto:support@nesi.org.nz){.mailto} at any time and we have a
team of folks ready to answer any questions you may have, big or small.
You can also find helpful user resources, links and documentation
through our online [User Support
Centre](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb).
