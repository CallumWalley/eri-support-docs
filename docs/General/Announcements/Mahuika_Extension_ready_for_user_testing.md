We're very close to launching Mahuika's new capabilities to the research
community -- from additional compute capacity to specialised tools for
supporting data-intensive research. There's just a few last steps in our
final preparations for launch, particularly related to user experience.
On that note...

**Join our early access user pool**

Earlier this month we welcomed our first tranche of early access testers
onto Mahuika's new CPU nodes. Now, we're looking to expand that pool
further and seeking users who can help us identify any issues with:

-   accessing the new nodes

-   codes that don't run or have issues running

-   documentation

-   comparing performance to the old nodes

As an early access user, you'd let us know of any issues, challenges, or
suggestions for improving your experience getting onto and using the new
nodes. We'd also welcome any testing that compares your job(s)
performance on the new nodes against the older nodes.

in a 'pre-production' state and so their performance may be unstable.

**Who's eligible for early access:**

-   any NeSI user with an active Mahuika or MƒÅui allocation

**What's in it for you:**

-   using our test project, you\'ll have free access to our newest and
    most powerful compute nodes (usage via the test project will be
    free-of-charge during this early access / testing phase)

-   ability to run what you want for the early access phase (eg. tackle
    a particularly large or complex run)

-   [option to request some targeted support to get your code up and
    running efficiently on the new
    technology]{#5cedfc69-d50f-499a-b509-f2073523d878
