We’re very close to launching Mahuika’s new capabilities to the research
community – from additional compute capacity to specialised tools for
supporting data-intensive research. There’s just a few last steps in our
final preparations for launch, particularly related to user experience.
On that note…

**Join our early access user pool**

Earlier this month we welcomed our first tranche of early access testers
onto Mahuika’s new CPU nodes. Now, we’re looking to expand that pool
further and seeking users who can help us identify any issues with:

-   accessing the new nodes

-   codes that don’t run or have issues running

-   documentation

-   comparing performance to the old nodes

As an early access user, you’d let us know of any issues, challenges, or
suggestions for improving your experience getting onto and using the new
nodes. We’d also welcome any testing that compares your job(s)
performance on the new nodes against the older nodes.

If you’d like to participate as tester / early access user for the new
Mahuika CPU nodes,
<a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new" class="css-tgpl01" title="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new"><span>reach out to NeSI Support</span></a>.
*Reminder:* these nodes are still in a ‘pre-production’ state and so
their performance may be unstable.

Further details on the early access testing can be found
<a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/5002335382543-Mahuika-Extension-Onboarding" class="css-tgpl01" title="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/5002335382543-Mahuika-Extension-Onboarding"><span>here</span></a>.

**Who’s eligible for early access:**

-   any NeSI user with an active Mahuika or Māui allocation

**What’s in it for you:**

-   using our test project, you'll have free access to our newest and
    most powerful compute nodes (usage via the test project will be
    free-of-charge during this early access / testing phase)

-   ability to run what you want for the early access phase (eg. tackle
    a particularly large or complex run)

-   option to request some targeted support to get your code up and
    running efficiently on the new technology

If you're interested in participating as tester / early access user for
temporary free usage of the new Mahuika CPU nodes,

Looking ahead, we'll keep you updated on our launch plans for these new
CPU nodes, as well as our progress with bringing Mahuika’s new GPU
resources online. If you have any questions at any time, email
