    <p><strong>Update as of 11:40 Thurs 30/3</strong></p>
<p>Regular SLURM services are restored. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by this outage.</p>
<p>Please note that whilst we are endeavouring to avoid any unplanned outages, further incidents are more likely in the early-life phase of the new HPC platforms. We appreciate your continued patience whilst NeSI systems engineers work to stabilise systems and procedures with our vendor partners.</p>
