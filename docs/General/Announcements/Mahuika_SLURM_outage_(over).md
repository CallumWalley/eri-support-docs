**Update as of 11:40 Thurs 30/3**

Regular SLURM services are restored. We apologise for any inconvenience
caused by this outage.

Please note that whilst we are endeavouring to avoid any unplanned
outages, further incidents are more likely in the early-life phase of
the new HPC platforms. We appreciate your continued patience whilst NeSI
systems engineers work to stabilise systems and procedures with our
vendor partners.

**Original announcement**

Since approx 23:50 Weds 29/8 we are experiencing a problem with Slurm
services on Mahuika.

No new jobs are able to run at present and jobs that completed overnight
may not be showing the correct status.

Our systems engineers are currently working on the issue. We will make
an update to this announcement when further information is available
and/or the issue is resolved.
