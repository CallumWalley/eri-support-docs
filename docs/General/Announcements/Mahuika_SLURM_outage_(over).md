**Update as of 11:40 Thurs 30/3**

Regular SLURM services are restored. We apologise for any inconvenience
caused by this outage.

Please note that whilst we are endeavouring to avoid any unplanned
outages, further incidents are more likely in the early-life phase of
the new HPC platforms. We appreciate your continued patience whilst NeSI
systems engineers work to stabilise systems and procedures with our
vendor partners.
