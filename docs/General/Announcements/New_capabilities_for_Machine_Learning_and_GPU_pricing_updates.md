<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">We’re excited to announce an addition of new GPU capabilities to our platform and some noteworthy changes to resource pricing as a result.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"> </p>
<p><strong>New Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</strong></p>
<p>We’ve installed eight NVIDIA A100 GPU cards into the <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000163575-Mahuika" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mahuika HPC system</a>, providing a significant boost in computing performance and an environment particularly suited to machine learning workloads. Over the last few months we’ve worked directly with a group of beta tester researchers to ensure this new capability is fit-for-purpose and tuned to communities' specific software and tool requirements. </p>

<p><strong>Reduced pricing for P100s</strong></p>
<p>We’ve recently reviewed our <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001385735-What-is-an-allocation-">pricing</a> and reduced the price of our existing <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-p100/">P100</a> GPUs to 7.0 compute units per device-hour. The P100 GPUs are available to any project with a Mahuika allocation so if you have an existing allocation on Mahuika, you can access the P100s right away.</p>
<p>If you need a larger or new allocation on Mahuika, you can <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/applyforaccess">apply for access</a> now, but requests will likely be considered as part of our next allocation call window: <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/services/high-performance-computing-and-analytics/guidelines/allocations-allocation-classes-review#window"><span class="fabric-editor-annotation" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="002aaecf-7fd3-4a49-846d-50a7a88096a6">31 August - 01 October</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing our learning along the way</strong></p>
<p>If you’re curious about what it takes to get the best of the A100 cards, you can learn about our experiences in the first post of a new ‘Tech Insights' blog series: <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/case-studies/tech-insights-behind-scenes-look-rolling-out-new-gpu-resources-nz-researchers">Tech Insights: A behind-the-scenes look at rolling out new GPU resources for NZ researchers</a>.</p>
<p>Our inaugural post discusses our first tasks with the A100s: thermal and internal software tests. In future posts, we’ll explore user tests we conducted in the spaces of deep learning and molecular dynamics codes, as well as take a closer look at which codes are suitable to run on GPUs and whether your research project is a fit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Future GPU investments</strong></p>
<p>Looking ahead, we’re currently finalising another investment into additional GPU cards later this year. We’re also exploring the A100s' Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) features, which partition the cards into several independent instances, giving multiple users access to GPU acceleration at the same time.</p>
<p>These activities will enable us to expand GPU access to an even broader community of users, as well as support more advanced and demanding performance needs across domains. <span class="fabric-editor-annotation" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="d92de427-dd8f-4965-a484-8faf3deebc67">If you’re interested in using these A100s for something other than machine learning, let us know by </span><a href="mailto:https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new"><span class="fabric-editor-annotation" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="d92de427-dd8f-4965-a484-8faf3deebc67">contacting NeSI Support</span></a><span class="fabric-editor-annotation" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="d92de427-dd8f-4965-a484-8faf3deebc67"> - that way we can keep you up to date on our plans. </span></p>
