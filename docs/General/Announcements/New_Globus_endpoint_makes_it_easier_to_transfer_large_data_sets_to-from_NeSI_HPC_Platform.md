[NeSI has created a new endpoint to improve data transfer capabilities
to and from NeSI\'s HPC platform. The new endpoint is called
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**NeSI Wellington DTN V5** [and we encourage
you to begin using it immediately. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[The old NeSI endpoint, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[NeSI Wellington
