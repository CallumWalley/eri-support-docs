NeSI has created a new endpoint to improve data transfer capabilities to
and from NeSI's HPC platform. The new endpoint is called **NeSI
Wellington DTN V5** and we encourage you to begin using it immediately.

The old NeSI endpoint, *NeSI Wellington DTN*, will be deactivated on 8
December 2021.  
  

**What this change means for you:**

-   If you've ever created a bookmark or shared a collection to the NeSI
    endpoint, you will need to re-create and/or re-share using the new
    endpoint name - **NeSI Wellington DTN V5**.[Instructions are
    available
    here](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/4409759247887-Re-creating-Shared-Collections-and-Bookmarks-in-Globus-V5).

**Endpoint functionality improvements:**

Some of the improvements you'll notice as a result of the endpoint
upgrade include:

-   HTTPS (web) access for easier data downloading and uploading
    directly from browsers
-   '*Shared Collections*' are now called '*Guest Collections*'

**User Q&A session:**

We hosted a short information session on 24 November to share more
details and a demo of the new endpoint features. The recording is
embedded below:
