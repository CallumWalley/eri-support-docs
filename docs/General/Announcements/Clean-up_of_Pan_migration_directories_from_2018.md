In 2018, as part of our migration of projects from the Pan cluster to
NeSI's new clusters housed in Wellington, we copied Pan users\' project
data on Pan to a special area of disk space. At that time, we informed
Pan users this directory was intended as a temporary space.

To ensure NeSI's storage systems continue to operate at their highest
performance, we will be deleting these legacy Pan-related directories in
March. If you are a former Pan user, action is required from you as part
of this clean-up process. You should have received an email from us on
13 February, explaining what action is required. (If you didn\'t receive
an email, but believe you should have, please [contact
Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new)).

A summary of the instructions from that email is shared below:

-   **If you\'ve already retrieved your Pan-migrated data**\
    If you and your colleagues have already retrieved all the data you
    need from
    [[/nesi/project/\<project\_code\>/pan\_project]{mark-type="annotation"
    mark-annotation-type="inlineComment"
    data-id="aab75685-9ad6-45a0-b863-4bc470fb50e5"}]{.code}, please
    [contact Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new)
    to confirm you are no longer using this directory. We will then
    delete the directory and no further action by you is required.

-   **If you still need to retrieve your Pan-migrated data**\
    If there is data that you still need to retrieve, you must complete
    this task by the close of business on **[Thursday 12
    ]{mark-type="annotation" mark-annotation-type="inlineComment"
    data-id="22175b8c-de00-437a-9be9-3ebcb4824975"}March**. Data can be
    moved to your other project directories on NeSI, such
    as [/nesi/project/\<project\_code\>]{.code}
    or [/nesi/nobackup/\<project\_code\>]{.code} (keeping in mind our
    [new automated expiry
    process](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001162856 "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001162856"){.sc-jeCdPy
    .lnTQAz} for the /nobackup directory), or to somewhere else
    altogether (such as institutional storage). If you have questions
    regarding where to move your data or if you require assistance with
    retrieving your data, [please contact
    us](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new"){.sc-jeCdPy
    .lnTQAz}. If you believe you will not be able to retrieve your data
    before Thursday 12 March, please let us know as soon as possible so
    we can discuss alternative arrangements with you.\
    \
    Once you have finished retrieving all the data you wish to keep,
    [please contact
    us](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new"){.sc-jeCdPy
    .lnTQAz} and we will delete the directory (along with whatever
    remains in it).

*Note:*\
If you are unable to log in to the NeSI computing clusters to retrieve
your project\'s data, please [submit a support
ticket](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new"){.sc-jeCdPy
.lnTQAz} and someone from NeSI Support will assist you.

Thank you,

NeSI Support
