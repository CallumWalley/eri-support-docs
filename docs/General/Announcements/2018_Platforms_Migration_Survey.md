[Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete our New Platforms
Survey. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[We had an excellent response rate, with 174 users providing information
that will help NeSI improve your experience on our systems. Overall, the
majority of users said their experience transitioning to our new systems
went well, with 64% of respondents reporting that the issues they
encountered were resolved through the process. Another 36% of
respondents still have issues outstanding, which we will continue to
investigate. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[We asked users to identify which stages of the migration process they
encountered issues, and 121 people identified the following
areas:]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Overall, the majority of user feedback we received centred around four
predominant themes:]{style="font-weight: 400;"} 

-   **Increased security requirements**
-   **Challenges logging into the platform**
-   **Access to support (training and documentation)**
-   **Status of Data Transfer Service**

 

[Below is a quick response to some of the common issues you raised in
each of those themes:]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Increased security requirements**

-   [Difficulty setting up the multi-factor
    authentication]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Password reset]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[\
    \
    ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Multi-Factor Authentication was added to the login process of all NeSI
facilities to provide stronger protection against unauthorised access.
Using multi-factor authentication helps keep your data and our systems
safe. We acknowledge that our implementation of multi-factor
authentication was not as seamless as it should have been. It is a
work-in-progress and we recognise this was a pain point for many
researchers who migrated to the new platforms. Please contact NeSI

if you are having issues and we will do our best to assist
you.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Challenges logging into the platform**

-   [Some users reported issues and system behaviours that prevented
    them from logging in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Some users said the instructions for logging in were difficult to
    follow]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[\
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[We are working on a number of the issues
raised, from multi-factor authentication details to password expiry
notifications. We are also reviewing our login documentation to ensure
the instructions are clear, concise, and useful for guiding users
through the login process. As a next step, we will be adding new
questions and troubleshooting tips to our

]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

**Access to support (training and documentation)**

-   [Many people said they appreciated how willing the NeSI support team
    has been to support them ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Some users indicated they would like to receive more training in
    topics such as using NeSI efficiently, software installation,
    etc.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Some users reported difficulty finding the right support
    documentation on our support centre]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Some users reported that support response was a bit
    slow]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[\
    \
    ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Thank you for acknowledging the efforts of our support team, who have
worked tirelessly during this migration and who attempt to respond to
queries as quickly as they can. Your specific feedback on our support
documentation has been useful and will help us make the [NeSI User
Support
Centre](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb)]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ easier
to navigate. We are currently refining our [training
modules](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000359056-Training-and-Related-Resources)]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ to
better serve beginners to advanced HPC users. In the future, we will
look at implementing training modules for specific topics.

**Status of the Data Transfer Service**

-   [Some users reported that they were unable to move data to/from the
    new platforms efficiently without the Globus file transfer service
    in place]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Basic SSH based data-transfer, the only option currently available on
the new platforms, is inadequate for large data-sets. We acknowledge
this has caused inconvenience for you and has made it difficult to
continue your research. It is a priority for us to get Globus up and
running, and good progress has been made with public availability
expected in January 2019 and limited availability
earlier.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

 

[Migrating to the new machines has been an exciting journey for both our
team and our users, and a smooth (if not entirely seamless) transition
for users has always been a top priority. Thank you again for your
overwhelming patience and understanding through this
process.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[If you have any unresolved issues, please don't hesitate to send us a
request via
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[support\@nesi.org.nz]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[
and we will work with you to get these
sorted.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
