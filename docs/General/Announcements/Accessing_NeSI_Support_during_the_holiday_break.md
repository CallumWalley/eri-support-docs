As another busy year draws to a close, NeSI’s Support Team will be
taking a summer break from **5:00 PM on 22 December, 2022 to 9:00 am on
04 January, 2023.**

During this time, [NeSI platform services](https://status.nesi.org.nz/)
will be online and available, but non-critical support requests will be
responded to when the team is back on 04 January.

Urgent / critical requests will be addressed on a best effort basis. Any
changes to system status will be reported via our [System Status
page](https://status.nesi.org.nz/ "https://status.nesi.org.nz/") and
alerts.

A quick reminder of our main support channels as well as other sources
of self-service support:

    Support](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new "https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/requests/new") (Note:

    2023)
