Currently we are experiencing a problem with Slurm on Mahuika. We will
make a further announcement when the issue is resolved - Current
expectation is that it will take at least 2 hours to resolve.Â  We will
update this announcement with new information as it comes to hand.

**Slurm services have been restored as of 12.00 noon NZST
(15-Aug-2018)**
