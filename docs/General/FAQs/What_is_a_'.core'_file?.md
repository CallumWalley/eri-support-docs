<p>.core files are created when a program fails in a way that can't be handled by the program's regular error handling. Normally these failures are memory-related, such as the program asking for too much memory or for memory it can't legally access. The creation of a core file is called a 'core dump'.</p>
<p>.core files are a record of the working memory at time of failure, and can be used for <a href="https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001008136" target="_self">debugging</a>. MPI jobs will usually create a .core file for each task.</p>
<p>As .core files are usually very large, you should delete the ones you don't plan on using them to avoid filling up yourÂ storage quota.</p>
