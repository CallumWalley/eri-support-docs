In general, the **project directory** should be used for reference data,
tools, and job submission and management scripts. The **nobackup
directory** should be used for holding large reference working datasets
(e.g., an extraction of compressed input data) and as a destination for
writing and modifying temporary data. The nobackup directory can also be
used to build and edit code, provided that the code is under version
control and changes are regularly checked into upstream revision control
systems. The **long-term storage service** should be used for larger
datasets that you only access occasionally and do not need to change in
situ.
