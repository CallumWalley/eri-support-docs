## How the portal works

NeSI is using product portals to share product features, ideas and
invite feedback from users.

### Cards on the portal {#Cards-on-the-portal}

The Portal presents a number of "features" or "ideas" that you can
provide feedback on. Each idea/feature on the Portal is represented as a
"card".

### Submit feedback/ideas {#Invite-feedback/comments}

Select a card, choose the importance and add let us know why this is
important to you as well as your email address.

When users provide feedback on features/ideas in this way, their
feedback is routed back to our Insights board.

You can also submit brand new ideas on the Portal. These will be routed
to our Insights board as well and reviewed by the product management
team.

### What happens to the feedback? {#Closing-the-feedback-loop}

Any submission will reach our Insights inbox. We will review and action
the feedback accordingly.

When appropriate, a portal card will be updated or created and published
so other users can upvote the idea. Once we\'ve reached a decision, an
update can be sent to all users who voted for a feature on the Portal,
or to all these users as well as anyone who provided an insight that was
linked to the feature.
