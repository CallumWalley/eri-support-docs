<h2 id="how-the-portal-works">How the portal works</h2>
<p>NeSI is using product portals to share product features, ideas and invite feedback from users.</p>
<h3 id="Cards-on-the-portal">Cards on the portal</h3>
<p>The Portal presents a number of “features” or “ideas” that you can provide feedback on. Each idea/feature on the Portal is represented as a “card”.</p>
<h3 id="Invite-feedback/comments">Submit feedback/ideas</h3>
<p>Select a card, choose the importance and add let us know why this is important to you as well as your email address.</p>

<div class="heading-anchor-wrapper">
<div class="sc-dHIava kgjRRC">
<div>When users provide feedback on features/ideas in this way, their feedback is routed back to our Insights board.</div>

<h3>Submit new idea</h3>
<p>You can also submit brand new ideas on the Portal. These will be routed to our Insights board as well and reviewed by the product management team.</p>

<h3 id="Closing-the-feedback-loop">What happens to the feedback?</h3>
<p>Any submission will reach our Insights inbox. We will review and action the feedback accordingly.</p>
<p>When appropriate, a portal card will be updated or created and published so other users can upvote the idea. Once we've reached a decision, an update can be sent to all users who voted for a feature on the Portal, or to all these users as well as anyone who provided an insight that was linked to the feature.</p>
