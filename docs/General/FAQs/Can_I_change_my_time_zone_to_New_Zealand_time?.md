The time displayed in your shell is controlled by a system variable
called
`TZ`{style="font-family: Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;"}.
To change to New Zealand time you need to set the variable as follows:

    export TZ="NZ"

This setting will automatically adjust for daylight saving, since the
`tzdata` package is installed at the system level. Our system engineers
will keep the `tzdata` package up to date.

Making the change persistent
----------------------------

You can make your time zone setting persistent by adding the above line
to your
`~/.bashrc`{style="font-family: Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;"}.
If you do this, we recommend adding the following line to your
`~/.bash_profile`, or to your `~/.profile` if you have the latter but
not the former:

    test -r ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

Please see the article, \"[.bashrc or
.bash\_profile?](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001194536)\"
for more information.

What about cron jobs?
---------------------

To have the specifications in your crontab file interpreted as NZ times
start it with:

    CRON_TZ=NZ

Also note that cron does notÂ source either `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.bash_profile`, so most environment variables will not be set,
including TZ.
