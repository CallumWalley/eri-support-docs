Recent changes to our authentication system have caused some problems
for people who log in to NeSI HPC systems using MobaXTerm on Windows.

To fix these problems, you will need to do the following:

1.  Upgrade your MobaXTerm to the most recent stable version. You can
    download the most recent stable version
    fromÂ <https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net>.
2.  If you have created saved sessions to connect to NeSI HPC
    facilities, open the settings for each such saved session and under
    the "Advanced SSH settings" tab, change the SSH browser type from
    SFTP to something else, such as "SCP (enhanced speed)".
3.  If you are prompted multiple times for password (rather than First
    Factor), this is a bug. Entering any text will cause your login
    attempt to fail. The expected procedure is as follows.

<!-- -->

    ssh <user>@lander.nesi.org.nz
    <user>@lander.nesi.org.nz's password: <Press Enter> 
    <user>@lander.nesi.org.nz's password: <Press Enter> 
    <user>@lander.nesi.org.nz's password: <Press Enter>
    Login Password (First Factor):
    Authenticator Code (Second Factor):
