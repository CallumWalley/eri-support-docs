### How to request an account

Logging in to NeSI resources is primarily accomplished via SSH (or
"secure shell"). This is a method of getting a command-line interface on
our clusters, which runs a version of the Linux operating system. For
more details on how to connect to our systems, please visit

[Connecting to the NeSI Clusters via
SSH](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001016335)

If that sounds too intimidating, and you would like to try a zero-client
web-browser approach to using NeSI, you can log in to our JupyterHub:
[https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/)

For an introduction to the features of Jupyter on NeSI, check out
[Jupyter on
NeSI](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360001555615)

Small files can be moved to and from NeSI systems inside of Jupyter. SCP
(Secure CoPy) is another common method. If you have a large amount of
data to move, you can schedule transfers via [Globus on
NeSI.](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000576776)\

Instructions to be executed by the node(s) assigned to you when your
request for resources can be met by the scheduler -- can get very
complicated, so it's best to refer to the documentation for the software
you want to use to get started.

[Submitting your first
job](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000684396)

We also have a more detailed guide on the batch system that we recommend
new users read. It provides information about scheduling, job submission
and how to write scripts to accomplish various tasks.

year. For more information on when we hold these and how to register
your interest, see [NeSI Introductory
Workshop](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000428676).
